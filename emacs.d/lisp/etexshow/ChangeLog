	* etexshow.el (etexshow-quit, etexshow-cmd): make work with xemacs

2003-10-01  Patrick Gundlach  <patrick@gundla.ch>

	* etexshow.el (etexshow-version): cleaned up the todo list

2003-09-11  Patrick Gundlach  <patrick@gundla.ch>

	* etexshow.el (etexshow-cmd): ConTeXt :) sensitive invocation.
	When running etexshow-cmd and the cursor is at a word, this word
	will be looked up in the commands-buffer.

2003-04-08  Patrick Gundlach  <patrick@gundla.ch>

	* etexshow.el (etexshow-quit): Removes comment buffer, unless
	etexshow-keep-comment-buffer is non nil. Now deletes windows only
	if they are available. Version Alpha 5a

2003-04-06  Patrick Gundlach  <patrick@gundla.ch>

	* etexshow.el: added line break when a lot of parameters appear
	on the right side of the explanation.

2003-02-06  Patrick Gundlach  <patrick@gundla.ch>

	* etexshow.el: Removed installation instructions.

	* README.txt: Added installation instructions.

	* Makefile: now make dist will create a zip file and a tgz file
	with the files to be distributed.

2003-01-26  Patrick Gundlach  <patrick@gundla.ch>

	* etexshow.el: the help display does not use an external file
	anymore. So there won't be any errors like `file not found'.
	Extended help page. This will be release `Alpha 5'.

2003-01-25  Patrick Gundlach  <patrick@gundla.ch>

	* etexshow.el: Added multiple language comments. The
	comments-file has for each comment a language attribute. There is
	a list of allowed languages (`etexshow-language-filter') and a
	current language. You can toggle the current language with
	`L'. Only languages from the list of allowed languages can be
	used. 
	Added a command history mechanism. When you jump to a command via
	a hyperlink, type `B' to get back to the originating command.
	Added hyperlink navigation for keyboard. This is bound to
	`J'. Afterwards the user needs to input the number of the
	hyperlink. Tested with xemacs. It looks as if etexshow is almost
	feature complete (for a beta release).

	* pgxml.el: (almost) all namespace references are removed. Don't
	know if this is a nasty hack, but it allows me to parse the same
	files without the namespace in the element names. So <cd:command>
	is now <command>.

	* etexshow.el: Now missing xml files or not writable directories
	for cache file will generate an error. This took me some time to
	track down, since my xemacs has no working debug-on-error
	feature. I thought it was xemacs fault, but this time it is
	innocent... 
	Bound all 'self-insert-command' keys to isearch functionality.
	Inserted help page to be viewed with `H' or `?'. Created
	hyperlinks for the inherit="..." fields. These are displayed as
	"see \somecommand (1)". So you can toggle the display of
	somecommand with the number-key 1. Multiple levels possible. Try
	\definecombinedlist! Added mouse support for hyperlinks. Button 1
	will toggle command, button 2 jums to cmd.
	Made overlays to work with xemacs (again). Removed all
	overlay-properties and changed them to overlay-faces.

	* etexshow.el: Always replace cd:something with <something>,
	regardless of the position in the string. Etexshow now accepts
	the <choice> element and displays a vertical bar | to indicate a
	choice. See \setupinterlinespace for an (the) example. Changed
	the way the xml and cache files are handled. You can now have
	more than one xml and cache file (say one official and one with
	your own commands). The cache will be generated when a) there is
	no cache file yet and b) when the xml-file gets updated. So the
	user has to copy the xml-file and not worry about an old cache.

2003-01-22  Patrick Gundlach  <patrick@gundla.ch>

	* etexshow.el: made isearch and comments to work with xemacs
	21.4. :( I don't know how to find files with a special coding
	system (utf-8). Creates a comment file if necessary.
	Added overlay.el to etexshow distribution for xemacs users.

2003-01-21  Patrick Gundlach  <patrick@gundla.ch>

	* etexshow.el: Fixed some bugs concerning commenting the
	commands. Removed superfluous spaces in output that would sneak
	into the comments file. Actually: all basic commenting
	functionality is implemented. Not yet supported: inherit,
	language, generation of the surrounding xml-tags. 

2003-01-10  Patrick Gundlach  <patrick@gundla.ch>

	* etexshow.el: Greatly improved startup speed when already
	started once. The hash table and the commands list won't be
	regenerated. Added Hook etexshow-mode-hook, which starts right
	after the cursor in the command buffer can be seen. 
	Isearch facility improved: isearch does not start at the
	beginning of a line ('start' matches \definestartstop). There is
	a command to search again forward or backward. 

2003-01-09  Patrick Gundlach  <patrick@gundla.ch>

	* etexshow.el: mouse support added (wheelmouse). Better cursor
	keys support: you now cannot move past the last entry with the
	cursor down. Support for page up/down. These keys will scroll one
	page down. Mouse button 1 will show the current entry. Tested
	with xemacs.

2003-01-08  Patrick Gundlach  <patrick@gundla.ch>

	* etexshow.el: added xemacs compatibilty.
