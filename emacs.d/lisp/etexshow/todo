etexshow todo and bugs:
=======================
Please send comments to patrick@gundlach.ch
Current Version: Alpha 5b

Bugs:
-----
1) two commands are missing from the xml-file: \remark and \menubutton
2) cd:something = <something> is hardcoded
3) toggle-command behaves strange when there are more commands
   referenced and (e.g.)the last one is opened first
4) toggle language behaves strange when this lang is removed from the
   filterlist. 

TODO:
-----

* make face for insertstring --------comment starts here ---------

* make etexshow-with-face macro independant of count, face

Next version:
-------------

Some future version:
--------------------
* use customization
* make all of cont-en.xml work
* make other interfaces (cont-nl, cont-de...) work
* Perhaps some functionality to merge comments
  from other people in order to build some documentation that is
  shared in the community.
