# Prefix search!  Type "s" then press up -- only search through history that
# started with "s" -- e.g. "ssh", "source", etc.
#
# Since this is .inputrc, this is automatically turned on for many different
# programs: bash, irb, python, mysql, octave, etc etc.  sweet.
#
# For any of these programs, if you configure history to persist across
# sessions, then this becomes a usage search feature.  For example, I type "ss"
# then start pressing up to scroll through all machines I've ssh'd to in the
# last several months.  (C-r reverse search can do this too, but for some
# reason prefix search feels much nicer.)  If I can't remember how to type a
# specific command, I can just prefix search for its beginning, e.g. "ki"
# reveals "kill -9 %1".
